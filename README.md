# Fruit image classification




## Descuision

In this project we will classify the images of fruits from the Fruits dataset. The dataset contains images of fruits captured using a Logitech C920 camera. Behind the fruits, a white sheet of paper is placed as a background.

We will build the model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).


## Set up guide:

Load the dataset into Colab directly from Kaggle.

Explore the contents of the dataset, display the images, and augment them.

Then create our model, classify the images and see the performance of the mode

Specify the train and test directory’s path. Next, display the image, convert it to an array and print the array’s shape.
